### Status
The home screen gives you quick heads up on the staus of your upcoming duty:

- Good To Go: there are no notifications
- Nice To Know: there are notifcations that maybe of interest 
- Need to Know: there are notifications that we **strongly recommend you review prior to undertaking a duty** as they impact your decision to undertake the duty.

### Notifications
fittofly notifcations fall into 2 buckets; the 'Nice to Know's and the 'Need to Know's:
- 'Nice to Knows' are notifications we think you may find useful, such as eligibility for an overnight stay in  hotel or that your duty has been classed as disruptive. 'Nice to Knows' are supported by an amber coloured icon and do not impact your ability to fly within the defined limits.

- 'Need to Knows' are notifications we **strongly recommend you review prior to undertaking a duty** as they impact your decision to fly. Notifications will include 'Max FDP Exceeeded' and 'Insufficient Rest Period' 
'Need to Knows' are supported by a red coloured icon.
